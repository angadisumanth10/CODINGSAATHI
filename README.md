Calculator

A simple calculator built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a basic application that allows users to perform simple arithmetic calculations. The calculator is designed to have a user-friendly interface with buttons representing different mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The HTML code of the calculator includes a basic structure with a form element that contains the input and output fields for the calculator. The input field is used to display the numbers and the output field can display the result of the mathematical operation.

The JavaScript code is used to handle the mathematical operations and perform the calculations based on the user's input.

The CSS code is used to style the calculator interface, making it visually appealing and easy to use. This is done by adding colors, Hovers, and fonts to the buttons and input fields.

I hope this will be a useful application..
