        <p>Kuppali Venkatappa Puttappa (29 December 1892 to 11 November 1994), was an Indian poet, playwright, novelist
            and critic. He is widely regarded as the greatest Kannada poet of the 20th century. He was the first Kannada
            writer to receive the Jnanpith Award.</p>
        <p>Kuvempu was born in Hirekodige, a village in Koppa taluk of Chikmagalur district and raised in Kuppalli, a
            village in Shivamogga district of the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore (now in Karnataka) into to a
            Kannada-speaking Vokkaliga family.[7] His mother Seethamma hailed from Koppa, Chikmagalur, while his father
            Venkatappa was from Kuppali, a village in Thirthahalli taluk (in present-day Shimoga district), where he was
            raised.[10][7] Early in his childhood, Kuvempu was home-schooled by an appointed teacher from South
            Canara.[citation needed] He joined the Anglo-Vernacular school in Thirthahalli to continue his middle school
            education. Kuvempu's father died when he was only twelve. He finished his lower and secondary education in
            Kannada and English languages in Thirthahalli and moved to Mysore for further education at the Wesleyan High
            School. Thereafter, he pursued college studies at the Maharaja College of Mysore and graduated in 1929,
            majoring in Kannada </p>
